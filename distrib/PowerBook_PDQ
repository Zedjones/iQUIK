iQUIK on a PowerBook PDQ
========================

The PDQ has a G3 and uses OpenFirmware 2.0.1.

You can boot from:
* Floppy untested (but probably works), since I have no drive.
* PCMCIA CF (see below)
* Internal IDE (see below)
* CD not yet tested

For some reason, OpenFirmware doesn't enumerate the Cardbus slots, and this prevents
booting from CF without some patches. Fortunately, this is not too crazy.

The following Forth code can be put into nvramrc:

---> CHOP <---
: probe-card select-dev " probe-pccard" my-self $call-method unselect-dev ;
: my-boot " ata2" probe-card " ata3" probe-card boot ;
---> CHOP <---

You can setenv boot-command to be my-boot now.

Note, you need to pass "video=ofonly video=offb" as extra kernel parameters, otherwise
your video will not work (psychodelic colors, bad timing and nothing visible since aty128fb
misinitializes the hardware).

To boot from internal IDE, put the following in your nvramrc:

---> CHOP <---
: $E device-end
: &c " ata-enable" $call-parent ;
devalias ide0 /pci/@10/ata0
devalias ide1 /pci/@10/@34/ata1
devalias ide4 /pci/@d/@34/ata4
dev /aliases
: $M delete-property ;
" ata-int" $M
" ata0" $M
" ata1" $M
" ata4" $M
dev ide0
: open use-ata-interface 0 &c -1 ;
: set-device-ID set-drive-select ;
$E
---> CHOP <---
