iQUIK on a UMAX StormSurge
==========================

The UMAX clone has a 604e (can be dual) and uses OpenFirmware 1.0.5.

It's a SCSI system.

You can boot from:
* Floppy
* Internal SCSI MESH harddrive
* CD boot is untested

OF defaults to ttya (first serial port) for input-device and output-device. I don't
like using serial, so I change mine to ADB keyboard and framebuffer.

input-device /bandit/gc/via-cuda/adb/keyboard

Since I have the IMS video, for me:

output-device /bandit/IMS,tt128mb

To boot from MESH SCSI disk:

boot-device /bandit/gc/mesh/sd@0:0

Follow the README.
