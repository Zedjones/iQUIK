\ This example shows how to boot iQUIK under qemu-system-ppc
\ with the OpenBIOS firmware and the floppy.img image
\ from iQUIK distrib.
\
\ Unlike a PowerMac's OF, OpenBIOS doesn't support partition-zero booting.
\ We could of course boot the 'second' ELF that the raw boot block
\ is generated from, but that would be cheating ;-).
\
\ Again, none of this is necessary on an OldWorld mac. Write floppy.img
\ to a floppy then do a "boot fd:0".
\
\ OpenBIOS has no FD support so just attach it to first ATA channel, like so.
\
\ $ ./ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc  -hda floppy.img -hdb install.img -serial stdin
\
\ [ install.img is assumed to contain the Debian wheezy bits from
\   http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/main/installer-powerpc/current/images/powerpc/hd-media/
\   ... ]
\
\ Then switch console to serial like -
\ " /pci/mac-io/escc/ch-a" output
\ " /pci/mac-io/escc/ch-a" input
\
\ ...and copy-paste in the rest of this file (or load it - this is a valid Forth file).

setenv load-base 3e0000

\
\ boot-file specifies where iQUIK will look
\ for the configuration file. This corresponds to
\ the second ATA disk (-hdb), first FAT partition.
\
setenv boot-file /pci/mac-io/ata-1/disk@1:1/yaboot.conf

\
\ OpenBIOS doesn't know how to parse the MAC "partition-zero"
\ boot descriptor, so we'll manually load it. XXX:2 refers
\ to the Apple_Boostrap partition on -hda, which in the floppy.img
\ image is the first parition (wonky indexing... yes).
\
\ I don't really understand why OpenBIOS needs the seek to 0.
\ Seems like a bug...
