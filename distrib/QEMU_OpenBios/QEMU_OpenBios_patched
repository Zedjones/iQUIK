iQUIK on QEMU with patched OpenBIOS r1272
===============================================================

Current (r1272) sources don't correctly support partition-zero booting,
and the pmac_generic_partition_zero.diff rectifies that.

Provided you patch the OpenBIOS sources with the pmac_generic_partition_zero.diff
patch, you should be able to boot as easy as:

$ qemu-system-ppc -hda your_disk.img -prom-env "boot-file=hd:3"

...provided your root file system is on the first partition following
the Apple_Bootstrap partition. XXX:2 refers to the Apple_Bootstrap
partition itself.

For the lazy, there's an openbios image prebuilt - openbios-qemu.elf

$ qemu-system-ppc -bios openbios-qemu.elf -and -so -on

Follow the directions in README.
