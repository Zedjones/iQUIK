iQUIK on a PowerBook 3400c
==========================

The 3400c has a 603ev and uses OpenFirmware 2.0.1.

You can boot from:
* Floppy
* Internal IDE HD
* PCMCIA CF
* CD boot is untested

Nothing crazy is needed. Just follow the directions in README.

I have tested that with the CD in the media bay I can boot a kernel
just fine (and the CD is recognised).
