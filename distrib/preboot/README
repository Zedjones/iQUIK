Using preboot scripts
=====================

Preboot scripts are a useful way of setting up some
OpenFirmware state before iQUIK figures out what to
boot.

This is useful for rescue floppies (so you don't have
to remember what disk to boot). This is also useful
for install media, but the later hasn't been tried
yet.

You can use it to patch OF, but be aware that the preboot
script is loaded as part of iQUIK. If you can't load
and pass control to iQUIK, then your script can't run.

Be careful around using '\' for comments. At least on the 3400c,
this ends up eating the rest of the script following the slash.
This is probably due to OF expecting Mac line endings '\r', instead
of UNIX ones, but why bother? Just use '( blah )' and
avoid grief...

It's documented in the README, but here is an example command
on installing a boot block with a preboot script:

$ iquik -p /my/special/preboot/script.of

The file 'example_menu' is an actual menu I use on a rescue floppy
for my 3400c. Nothing too crazy. The code is basically the
"grub on PPC -- a CHRP script" by Maurizio Boriani, from
