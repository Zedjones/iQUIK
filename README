iQUIK - the new old PowerMac bootloader
=======================================

iQUIK is an effort to maintain the old QUIK bootloader,
and is the only way to boot something recent on an
OldWorld, at least known to me.

[ As a proud owner of a '97 PB 3400c. iQUIK has been my
  painful journey towards running first 2.4 with initrd,
  and then 2.6 kernels ]

iQUIK differs from the plain-jane unmaintained QUIK in
a number of important ways:

1) It can boot large non-2.2 kernels.
2) It can load an initrd.
3) Introduces a layer to shim OF accesses during kernel
   bootup, to work around OF bugs:
   a) It tries working around OF 1.0.5 bugs but I've no
      systems to test with at the moment.
   b) It works around PB3400c hangs with media bay ATA
      discovery handling with 2.6 kernels.
   c) Works around OF 2.0.1 setprop bugs that manifest
      themselves as the kernel not finding its initrd.
4) It builds with a recent toolchain (GCC 4.4)
5) It doesn't require libext2fs, and yet supports
   symlinks and the "!ls" command.
6) It can boot from a floppy.
7) It can boot from anything via partition zero.
8) It drops the first stage loader and the finicky block maps,
   and drops the support for loading arbitrary blocks.
9) It can boot a kernel with an initrd without a quik.conf.
10) Code is significantly less crufty, although could still use
    quite a bit of work.


Support
=======

Although meant for OldWorlds in general, it has only been tested
on a PowerBook 3400c with OF 2.0.1. Testing on a UMAX clone
with 1.0.5 is next. It would be nice to test with 2.4 and
maybe even a NewWorld, although the later isn't a goal.

You can boot Wheezy (2.6.32). It can probably boot later
kernels too, although that is still untested.


Prebuilts
=========

I've checked-in the current prebuilts for iQUIK under distrib/.
* 'quik' is the installer, built under Wheezy.
* 'second.b' is the iQUIK boot code
* 'quik.conf' is pretty self-explanatory. It doesn't try to be
   exhaustive.
* 'floppy.img' can be written out to a 1.44MB and booted via 'boot fd:0'.

[ The 'floppy-cfg.img' is an example image with a config file. It can
  be booted with 'boot fd:0 fd:3/quik.conf'. If you're wondering
  how to create partitions either use loopback or a USB floppy, which
  appears as a SCSI device ]


Building
========

After fetching the sources.

$ make && make install


The boot flow
=============

OF will boot the device listed under the 'boot-device' environment variable.
In our case it has to be the "partition zero" of whatever device you
installed iQUIK onto.

iQUIK will then try to locate the quik.conf file using the path in
'boot-file'. 

For me:
boot-device     ata0/ata-disk@0:0
boot-file       ata0/ata-disk@0:4

...the later corresponds to /etc/quik.conf on /dev/hda4 on PB 3400c.

Another example:
boot-device     upper/pccard45,401@0:0
boot-file       upper/pccard45,401@0:3/installer/quik.conf 

iQUIK will then parse quik.conf similar to Yaboot, the old QUIK, MILO, LILO, etc.

You get the typical 'boot:' prompt. Tab shows the list of images defined
in your quik.conf, if any.

You can also type in custon image locations, thus booting any arbitrary
kernel with any initrd and any parameters, e.g.:
       [device:][partno]/vmlinux
       [device:][partno]/vmlinux -- kernel arguments
       [device:][partno]/vmlinux [device:][partno]/initrd kernel arguments


Installing
==========

Whatever medium you want to install QUIK on, it has to:
1) Be mac partitioned
2) Contain an Apple_Bootstrap partition.

iQUIK does not support any other way of booting.

Example (for floppy):
root@3400c:~# mac-fdisk /dev/fd0
/dev/fd0
Command (? for help): p
/dev/fd0
        #                    type name                length   base    ( size )  system
/dev/fd01     Apple_partition_map Apple                   63 @ 1       ( 31.5k)  Partition map
/dev/fd02         Apple_Bootstrap bootstrap             1600 @ 64      (800.0k)  NewWorld bootblock
/dev/fd03              Apple_Free Extra                 1216 @ 1664    (608.0k)  Free space

Block size=512, Number of Blocks=2880
DeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0

To do this I've used the 'i' command to initialize the partition table, and the 'b'
command to create the new 800K bootstrap partition.

Assuming the physical disk you've prepared as above contains your root partition
(with /boot), running 

$ quik

...should be sufficient. 'quik -v' for verbosity. 'quik -T -v' if you just want
to see what quik would have done. The tool will not do anything if you don't have
an Apple_Bootstrap partition.

If you want to install on some other media, use the '-d' flag:

$ quik -d /dev/fd0

If you want to use an alternate second.b (instead of the one in /boot), use the
'-b' flag:

$ quik -b /my/hacked/second.b

NOTE: the 'quik' tool doesn't set the NVRAM variables itself. You need to do that yourself.

Example:

[ I installed to /dev/hda ]

root@3400c:~# nvsetenv boot-device "ata0/ata-disk@0:0"

[ Configuration is on /etc/quik.conf on /dev/hda4 ]

root@3400c:~# nvsetenv boot-file "ata0/ata-disk@0:4"


Other stuff
===========

From OF prompt, you can boot it several ways.

0 > boot

[ assuming boot-device and boot-file was correctly set ]

0 > boot fd:0

[ assuming boot-file was correctly set ]

0 > boot fd:0 -- Linux26

[ assuming boot-file was correctly set, iQUIK will immediately
  boot the image specified by the label Linux26 ]

0 > boot fd:0 ata0/ata-disk@0:4 Linux24

[ tells iQUIK to load image Linux24 using the quik.conf file
  at ata0/ata-disk@0:4/etc/quik.conf ]

0 > boot upper/pccard45,401@0:0 upper/pccard45,401@0:4/installer/quik.conf

[ tells iQUIK to boot from a CF card in top PCMCIA slot with a custom
  quik.conf location on /dev/hdc4 ]

Once you're at the boot prompt.

boot: !ls

[ list files on the default device/partition - the default device/partition
  are the ones used to load quik.conf ]

boot: !ls /boot

[ list files under /boot on default device/partition ]

boot: !ls upper/pccard45,401@0:4/installer

[ list files under /install on partition 4 of CF card in top PCMCIA slot ]

boot: !halt

[ enters OF... type 'go' to get back ]

boot: !debug

[ will pause at important places during boot-up so you can track progress ]


Future development
==================

The next items I'll probably look at, are (in no order):

1) Testing with Debian/unstable and a 3.X kernel.
2) FAT and ISO9660 support.
3) OF 1.0.5 testing.
4) More uncruftification.
